                <hr>
                <p>Glorified Community Empowerment Trust is a gateway to success organisation whose goal is to empower
                    the marginalised societies in Zimbabwean and across Africa through business trainings and
                    investments. The organisation was formed in 2018. GCET is an entrepreneurial based organisation that
                    serves the community through creativity, innovation and enterprise. </p>

                <p>We derive our joy from empowering people with disabilities, young rural women in business and those
                    wishing to start businesses, orphans, widows the elderly and vulnerable children. We also support
                    parent support groups who have entrepreneurship as one of their pillars to alleviate poverty. </p>

                <p>Poverty has deprived our society of basic human needs like food, clothing, shelter, medication and
                    education. This has impacted heavily on success pathway institutions like orphanages elderly homes
                    and churches caring for the distressed in their areas of operation. Our team of business consultants
                    identifies the need, strategize the solution, tailor make trainings, deliver and monitor
                    implementation.</p>

                <p>Our project timeframe is a three year period per district to enable business growth and evaluations.
                    During this period investments in trainings, business capitalisation, further development,
                    evaluations and reviews will take place. A project replication plan will be crafted tailor-made to
                    suit the intended community.</p>

                        <h1>Statement of Need</h1>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Our marginal societies suffer from innate poverty. Orphans and vulnerable children, persons
                            with
                            a disability, widows, the elderly and also young rural women are the hardest hit. These
                            individuals and groups live on less than a dollar a day. </p>
                        <p>There are massive food shortages in the communities. They are deprived from a decent meal
                            hence
                            prone to malnutrition diseases. Most of them live on two light meals per day to keep them
                            alive.
                            A balanced diet in this context is usually a nightmare. For those in elderly homes and
                            orphanages food supply is a great challenge. Most communities have little to none good
                            floors of
                            income to sustain them hence the need to establish some projects.</p>
                        <p>Education is a cornerstone to human kind however poverty has denied our beloved communities.
                            Most
                            marginalised communities are not able to attend school due to lack of incomes to meet the
                            school
                            fees demand. A high rate of dropouts is experienced. A majority of these will contribute to
                            a
                            low literacy rate and create vulnerable communities. </p>
                        <p>The majority of the population in context has no decent shelter. It is usually a situation of
                            overpopulation or exposure to harsh weather and failure to afford basic utilities. These
                            need a
                            good income and some projects would be best suited a lasting solution.</p>

                        <p>Medical bills have posed a life threatening situation. In the face of the pandemics the poor
                            cannot survive the costs even the medical subsidy cannot reach far to them. HIV/AIDS,
                            malaria
                            corona virus and cancer to name a few have robed our loved ones due to poverty. </p>

                        <p>Through income generating projects at both individual and institutional levels more income
                            can be
                            generated to sustain a life. Communities have either tried and gave up or contemplated
                            starting
                            income generating projects to address their basic needs. GCET is there to bridge the
                            knowledge
                            gap and empower communities through entrepreneurship. Projects will be from all sectors of
                            the
                            economy with a major thrust in agriculture.</p>
